# Feature Request App

Build a web application that allows the user to create "feature requests" using Django Framework.

## Installation

This application requires:
- Django 2.2.3
- Python 3.4+

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

It is best to use the python virtualenv tool to build locally:
```bash
$ virtualenv venv-feature-request
$ source venv-feature-request/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
